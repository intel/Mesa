The 'bitstring.py' code included in this directory is strictly for reference, so that the project does not become completely broken should the bitstring module become unavailable from the 'pip' install repositories and/or the author's sites ( http://scott-griffiths.github.io/bitstring/ and https://github.com/scott-griffiths/bitstring ).
In that case, the source code file here (bitstring.py) is to be used to recreate the logic and interfaces needed by the rest of the (Intel CSME) decoder.

Use of this particular bitstring.py file for any other purpose is at your own risk.
